  What are some potential bugs?

### Scenario 2

After you raised some concerns, someone uploaded the video titled [`cats-bug.mp4`](cats-bug.mp4), with the following message:

> BUG! Deleting last item in list leads to unexpected behavior.

- Confirm what you are seeing is a bug
- Identify failure points
- Write a sample bug report based on the video - be as detailed as you can
